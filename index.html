                    <p>I am 31 years old and am married to my wife of seven years. We have a 15 month old son. I am an
                        aspiring full stack developer, with eagerness to learn and gain much experience in coding and web
                        development. I am a great team member and can work with many people; also can stay on task
                        with my assignments. I am not afraid to ask for help from teammates and am willing to help if asked
                        by anyone. I am agile in my work and know that communication is key. Team work makes the dream work.
                        I am a sports junky; I like watching baseball (college, and pro), basketball (college and pro),
                        college football, college volleyball (mens and womens), tennis (mens and womens). I played
                        basketball and baseball growing up; and tennis in high school. I like to be active and have fun.
                        Coming from a family of seven boys, I am very competitive.
